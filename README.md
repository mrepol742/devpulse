Measure and share your coding productivity with personalized leaderboards. Compare your progress with peers while keeping full control over privacy and leaderboard settings.

## Getting Started
Install the dependencies:

npm install
```

## Supabase

First by creating a supabase cloud project:

- go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
- click `New Project`
- choose:
  - Organization → (create one if needed)
  - Project Name → e.g. devpulse-waka
  - Database Password → choose a secure one
  - Region → pick the nearest location
- Click Create new project
- Wait a few moments for the database to be provisioned.

## Setup Environment

Copy the .env.example to .env

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env and fill in the values for:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Database Migrations

Login first (if you haven't):

```bash
npx supabase login
```

Link the cloud project to this local one:

```bash
npx supabase link
```

It'll show the list of project you have select your project.

Push migrations to cloud:

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

Pull migrations from cloud:

```bash
npx supabase db pull
```

Updating types (if you ever changed migrations):

```bash
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id <project-id> --schema public > app/supabase-types.ts
```
